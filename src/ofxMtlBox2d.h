//  Created by Elie Zananiri on 2013-02-16.
//
//  In order to deal with the two coordinate systems (pixels and meters),
//  any data passed or returned to any ofxMtlXXX object is assumed to be
//  in pixels, unless the method has the "B2" suffix in its name. For
//  rotations, the data is assumed to be in degrees, or in radians if the
//  method has the "B2" suffix. Got it?
